# üìä YouTube Video Analyzer & Snapshot Comparator

A Streamlit web app that allows you to:
1. **Analyze multiple YouTube videos** by providing their URLs.
2. **Download a CSV report** of video stats including title, views, likes, comments, tags, duration, and more.
3. **Compare two CSV snapshots** to see changes in views, likes, and comments over time.

## üöÄ Features
- Fetches **video metadata** from the YouTube Data API.
- Reads **API key** securely from a local `api_key.txt` file.
- Supports both **youtube.com/watch?v=** and **youtu.be/** link formats.
- Shows results in an **interactive Streamlit table**.
- Downloads CSV files with **timestamped filenames**.
- Uploads two previously saved CSV reports to **compare** changes.
- Displays **delta metrics** for views, likes, and comments.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinovator/youtube_stats_analyzer.git
   cd youtube_stats_analyzer
````

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create `api_key.txt`**

   * Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   * Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
   * Create an API key and save it in `api_key.txt` in the project folder.

   Example `api_key.txt`:

   ```
   YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with your script name.

---

## üìÇ CSV File Naming Convention

CSV reports are saved with a timestamp:

```
youtube_analysis_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv
```

The comparator uses this timestamp in filenames to determine when the snapshots were taken.
